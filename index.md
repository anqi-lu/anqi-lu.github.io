Hi, just another human being originally from China, went to school in the United States, and landed a job as software engineer at Google. I enjoy eating food, going places (as long as my visa allows), and taking [pictures](https://unsplash.com/@alu213000) when I go places.  

### Volunteering 

I'm currently volunteering as a teaching assistant for Intro to Computer Science at Excel High School in South Boston as part of [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals) program. 

In the past, I taught English as part of the [Women's Empowerment project](https://volunteeringjourneys.com/womens-empowerment-volunteer-india/) in Fort Kochi, Kerala.

### Working on
- Swimming: not knowing how to swim was a roadblock for me doing things related to water. (It didn't prevent me from surfing, but it was terrifying when I fell off the surfboard.) I'm currently taking swimming lessons and my favourite swimming style is actually butterfly ü¶ã
- Mindfulness: I've recently completed a 8-weeks Mindfulness course where I learned various methods of bring mindfulness in life (meditation, mindful yoga, mindful walking, and mindful eating). I'm trying to continue the journey by practicing every day!
